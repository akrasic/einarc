== v2.0

* New features:
** Dedicated hotspare support ("hotspare add", "hotspare delete" methods)
** Getting physical disc SMART attributes in unified form ("physical smart")
** Adapter restart method to reset an adapter, stop all arrays and reinitialize them ("adapter restart")
** Listing logical discs now also shows their /dev entries, if possible
** Getting WWN and enclosure ID for physical drives (attributes "wwn" and "enclosure" for "physical" object, software only)
** Getting adapter's expanders ID and model (method "expanders" for "adapter" object)
** Log dumping support ("log dump", for lsi_megacli only)
** Enabling/disabling WriteCache support for logical and physical discs ("writecache" attribute for "physical" and "logical" object, software only)
** Disabling powersaving support for logical and physical discs ("powersaving" attribute for "physical" and "logical" object, software only)
** BBU support (arcconf)
* Support for new adapters / chipsets, improved RAID autodetection:
** Adaptec 2405, Adaptec 51645, Adaptec 5405Z, Adaptec 5445Z, Adaptec 5805Z, Adaptec 6405, Adaptec 6805, Adaptec 6805Q
** Intel RS2BL040, Intel RS2BL080, Intel RS2WC040
** LSI 53C896/897-based, LSI MegaRAID SAS 9240-4i, LSI MegaRAID SAS 9260, LSI SRCSASLS4I
** SuperMicro SMC2108
* User friendliness:
** command line interface now hints what objects are available
** most objects and methods can be abbreviated akin to UNIX commands (i.e. "physical list" => "pd ls", "logical hotspare delete" => "ld hs rm", etc)
** adapter type and number specification can be omitted if there's only one adapater in the system
** more user-friendly error messages
** output is "humanized" by default if we use real tty for output
** added man pages: einarc(8), einarc-install(8), raid-wizard-clear(8), raid-wizard-passthrough(8), raid-wizard-optimal(8)
** prevent lsi_megacli from littering its log files around by default
* Bumped versions of proprietary CLI utilities:
** Areca 1.9.0_120503
** LSI MegaRC 1.11
** LSI MegaCLI 8.07.07
** 3Ware 9.5.0.1
** Adaptec Storage Manager v2.10.00 (not available for automatic download anymore)
** ArcConf 1.1.20324
* Compatibility issues:
** Ruby 1.9 compatibility, 1.8 should be still supported
** dash compatibility, bash is no longer required
** Workarounds for proprietary CLI calls that require Linux kernel 2.6.x explicitly to work on kernel 3.x
** Support for more than 26 logical discs (i.e. names like "sdaa" beyond "sda"-"sdz")
** Dropped HAL support: querying now uses udev, procfs and sysfs
** Explicitly disallowed software-RAID-on-top-of-hardware-RAID, added switch to disallow software-RAID-on-USB-mass-storage
* Infrastructure and API changes:
** Added testing framework using mock-up adapters CLI output, added tests for lsi_megacli and lsi_megarc
** All output is done to `@outstream` by default (which can be overridden), not `$stdout`
** Subversion -> Git transition, Git maintenance support
* Multiple bugfixes and minor improvements

== v1.4

* Support for post-build reconfiguration of proprietary CLIs and
supporting modules. This allows Einarc to be supplied via usual binary
packaging methods (rpm/deb): proprietary CLIs can be installed after
binary package installation using special setup tool "einarc-install".
* Experimental support for hardware RAID autodetection in both
build-time (configure) and run-time (einarc-install).

== v1.3

* Support for 3ware / AMCC controllers by Andras Horvath.
* Full read/write support of Linux software RAIDs.
* Updated all proprietary utilities URLs, pumped up version numbers,
fixed wrapper regular expressions to support new versions of CLIs.
* Added new calculated fields in adapter_info: PCI product/subproduct
and vendor/subvendor IDs. These allow precise identification of PCI
devices related to adapters shown by Einarc.
* Fuller BBU support for Adaptec adapters.
* Multiple stability and build fixes (Makefile now supports parallel
execution with "make -j").

== v1.2

* Support for new RAID devices: newer Adaptec adapters using arcconf.
* New objects "bbu" and "firmware" are introduced: now it's possible to
get information about BBU and read/write firmware to supported adapters.
* More strict "adapter info" report: it outputs serial number and tries
to pinpoint a particular adapter using PCI IDs, if possible.
* Updates for existing devices:
** aaccli: now it downloads and uses later, more acceptable version, not
linked against arts library. Note, however, that
Adaptec_Storage_Manager-Linux_v2.10.00 is a huge ~36M download.
** megacli: updated version to 1.01.27.
* Multiple stability, metadata and rare occurance fixes for all modules.
* Improved build system.
* "raid-wizard-passthrough" can be used to handle smaller groups of HDDs
(not all available devices).

== v1.1

* Added documentation in package
* Brand-new configure: now everything can be controlled from
command-line parameters, individual modules can be enabled/disabled at
compile time.
* Updated download/build mechanism: it asks for license agreement
interactively. For non-interactive builds, just touch proprietary/agreed
file.
* Bugfixes in lsi_megarc, adaptec_aaccli modules
* Compatibility with older Ruby (<1.8.6)

== v1.0

* First public release
