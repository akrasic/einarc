`-V`, `--version`::
  Print program version and exit.
`--help`::
  Show short help text and exit.
`-l`, `--list`::
  List all adapters found in system and exit.
`-h`, `--human`::
  Force output in human-readable format: tables would have headers and
  they will be formatted with spaces to ensure fixed width fields. By
  default, Einarc outputs data in human-readable format if being
  called standalone from command-line and in tab-separated format when
  being called from a script. Using this option forces "humanized"
  format, even in script context.
`-t`, `--type=TYPE`::
  type (manufacturer) of RAID adapter; use `-l` (`--list`) option to
  list all types of supported adapters.
`-a`, `--adapter=NUM`::
  select the adapter if multiple adapters of a given type are present.

You can omit `-t` if there's only one adapter type in the system.
Omitting `-a` would select first available adapter of that type.
