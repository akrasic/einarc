Note that command-line interface is always ready to provide a
hint. For example, one can forget almost everything and start with
just calling "einarc". If there's only one adapter available at the
system, things can go as easy as:

 $ einarc
 Object not specified; available objects: logical, physical, log, adapter, firmware, task, bbu

If there's more than 1 adapter in the system, one would get a message
hinting that one should specify which adapter we'll work with:

 $ einarc
 Multiple adapters exist: use --list to list all adapters, choose one and specify it with --type and --adapter
 $ einarc --list
 Type           Adapter #  Model                         Version
 lsi_megacli    0          MegaRAID SAS PCI Express(TM)  8.0.1-0038
 areca          1          ARC-1160                      PCI
 $ einarc --type=areca
 Object not specified; available objects: logical, physical, log, adapter, firmware, task, bbu

Let's start with showing all logical drives. We don't
know what method we should choose, but Einarc will give a hint:

 $ einarc logical
 Command not specified; available commands: list, add, delete, clear, get, set
 $ einarc logical list
 #  RAID level   Physical drives                 Capacity     Device  State
 1  5            0:1,0:2,0:4,0:5,0:8            762939.45 MB          normal
 2  1+0          0:6,0:7                        190734.86 MB          normal
 3  5            0:9,0:10,0:11,0:12,0:13       1907348.63 MB          normal
 4  1+0          0:15,0:16                      476837.16 MB          normal

Note that Einarc's output differs slightly when using Einarc in
console manually or using Einarc's output in a script. This is due to
so called "humanize" option, which is turned on automatically in case
of manual invocation from console. Note how output changes if we'll
simulate in-script output piping with simple `cat`:

 $ einarc logical list | cat
 1	5	0:1,0:2,0:4,0:5,0:8	762939.45	normal
 2	1+0	0:6,0:7	190734.86	normal
 3	5	0:9,0:10,0:11,0:12,0:13	1907348.63	normal
 4	1+0	0:15,0:16	476837.16	normal

Einarc has switched to "machine-readable" output, tab-separated values in columns. It's not as pretty for humans, but it's very useful for script processing. For example, we'd like to get IDs of all RAID 5 arrays:

 $ einarc logical list | cut -f1,2 | grep 5$ | cut -f1
 1
 3

More complex example: let's check if a physical drive is hotspare drive
or not. Such simple boolean flag is available as a property of
`physical` object, and Einarc will give a hint on how to get it and when
to add a reference to particular physical disc ID:

 $ einarc physical
 Command not specified; available commands: list, get, set
 $ einarc physical get
 Object identifier not specified
 $ einarc physical list
 ID      Model                    Revision       Serial                     Size     State
 0:1     WDC WD2000JD-00          08.02D08       WD-WMAL00000001       190734.86 MB  1
 0:2     WDC WD2000JD-00          08.02D08       WD-WMAL00000002       190734.86 MB  1
 ...
 $ einarc physical get 0:1
 Property not specified; available properties: hotspare
 $ einarc physical get 0:1 hotspare
 0

Getting a property of adapter is in fact even simpler: there shouldn't
be any IDs. Here we'll get a list of all RAID levels a particular
adapter supports:

 $ einarc adapter
 Command not specified; available commands: info, restart, get, set
 $ einarc adapter get
 Property not specified; available properties: coercion, raidlevels, alarm, rebuildrate
 $ einarc adapter get raidlevels
